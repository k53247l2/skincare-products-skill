## 📖 What Is This?

This is a **structured agent skill** that transforms any AI assistant into a dermatology-oriented cosmetic formulation analyst. Instead of evaluating products by brand reputation, marketing claims, or price, it applies:

- **First-principle reasoning** — identify the biological objective before analyzing ingredients
- **Evidence-based evaluation** — every mechanism claim mapped to an A–E evidence level
- **15-category ingredient ontology** — unified classification before any efficacy analysis
- **30 documented ingredient interactions** — synergy, antagonism, and conflict rules
- **Harmonic-mean confidence scoring** — five-factor uncertainty propagation
- **Per-category weight profiles** — 10 product types with optimized scoring dimensions
- **Citation Mode** — for medical/safety questions: claim extraction, evidence routing (guidelines/PubMed/regulatory), structured evidence cards, and 5-section answers with clickable source links

The framework contains **631 structured data entries** across ingredient databases, interaction rules, and scientific references.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Dual-Mode Architecture

The skill operates in two modes, automatically selected based on user input:

```
                    User Question
                         │
           ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
           ▼                           ▼
   Citation Mode ON              Citation Mode OFF
   (efficacy/safety/             (product analysis)
    disease questions)
           │                           │
           ▼                           ▼
   Problem Classification       Input → Validation
   → Claim Extraction           → Ontology Mapping
   → Evidence Routing           → Database Query
   → Evidence Ranking           → Interaction Analysis
   → Evidence Card              → Mechanism Analysis
   → 5-Section Output           → Architecture Analysis
   (with clickable links)       → Risk Analysis
                                → Skin Adaptation
                                → Confidence → Scoring
                                → 14-Section Report
```

### Scoring Formula (Product Analysis Mode)

```
Final_Score = Σ(PS × EM × IM × Weight) − Marketing_Penalty

PS = Presence Score (0.0–1.0): how well the product fulfills each dimension
EM = Evidence Multiplier: A=1.00  B=0.90  C=0.70  D=0.50  E=0.20
IM = Interaction Modifier: Synergy=1.10  Independent=1.00  Antagonism=0.85  Conflict=0.70
```

### Confidence

Five factors aggregated via **harmonic mean** (worst-factor-aware):

$$C = \frac{5}{\frac{1}{I} + \frac{1}{D} + \frac{1}{M} + \frac{1}{X} + \frac{1}{C}}$$

| Score | Label | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ≥ 80% | 🟢 High | Definitive language, numeric score |
| 60–79% | 🟡 Medium | Hedged language, numeric score with caveats |
| 40–59% | 🟠 Low | Qualitative only, no numeric score |
| < 40% | 🔴 Critical | "Insufficient data" — conservative mode |

## 🔬 Key Design Decisions

### 15-Category Ingredient Ontology

Every ingredient is classified into exactly ONE primary category before efficacy analysis:

```
Core Active [A] · Formula Support [FS] · Skin Conditioning [SC]
Texture Modifier [TM] · Preservative [P] · Solvent [S] · Chelator [C]
Emulsifier [E] · Stabilizer [ST] · Film Former [FF] · Colorant [CO]
Fragrance [FR] · Botanical [B] · Marketing [M] · Risk [R]
```

Risk `[R]` is additive — an ingredient can be both `[A]` (active) and `[R]` (safety concern).

### 6-Level Priority Hierarchy

When rules conflict:

```
Safety Rules > Scientific Evidence (A/B) > Internal Database
> Ontology Mapping > Mechanism Inference > Heuristic Estimation
```

### Cascading Fallback

```
Database match? → YES: full confidence
               → NO: Ontology match? → YES: infer + reduce confidence
                                     → NO: Mechanism inference? → YES: reduce further
                                                                → NO: "Unknown [name]" — never fabricate
```

### Category-Specific Weight Profiles

No two product types share the same scoring dimensions. Cleansers prioritize safety (30%), sunscreens prioritize UV protection (35%), shampoos prioritize anti-fungal evidence (40% when medicated), body washes prioritize surfactant quality (35%).

## 🚀 Usage

### As a Reasonix Code / Claude Code Skill

Place the entire `skincare-products-skill/` directory in your skills folder. The YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md` provides automatic activation triggers.

### As a ChatGPT Custom GPT

Use the portable single-file version. Paste the contents as the Instructions field.

### As a Cursor Rule

Place the rule content in `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/skincare.md`.

### Trigger Examples

**Product Analysis:**
```
"Analyze this ingredient list: Aqua, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol..."
"Is this sunscreen good?" [attach product photo]
"Compare these two moisturizers"
"Evaluate this anti-dandruff shampoo"
"Review this lip balm — it has menthol in it"
```

**Citation Mode (Medical/Safety Questions):**
```
"Does azelaic acid help with post-acne marks?"
"Is salicylic acid safe during pregnancy?"
"Can I use niacinamide if I have rosacea?"
"Is it true that skin absorbs best at 10pm?"
"Will this ingredient cause acne?"

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Guards

The framework includes explicit anti-hallucination rules to prevent common AI failure modes in cosmetic analysis:

- Never assume concentration without declared evidence
- Never infer efficacy from ingredient count or popularity
- Rinse-off products (body wash, shampoo, conditioner): ingredients in the last third of the ingredient list → trace concentration → reclassify as Marketing `[M]`
- Experience ingredients (menthol, camphor, sea salt) → sensory engineering only → `[M]`
- Collagen, peptides, stem cells, gold in topical products → always `[M]`
- "Used for centuries" ≠ clinical evidence → Evidence D at best
- Database missing → "Insufficient Evidence" — never fabricate
- No interaction rule found → Independent (IM 1.00) — never invent interactions

### Citation Discipline (v2.2)

In Citation Mode, five non-negotiable rules govern evidence presentation:

- **No false correspondence** — never cite an ingredient study as proof a specific product is clinically validated
- **No low-level evidence as clinical proof** — in vitro ≠ human efficacy; mechanistic citations must carry explicit caveats
- **Three-class separation** — every answer separates literature-supported, formulation-inferred, and uncertain conclusions
- **Safety → safety sources** — pregnancy, long-term use, comedogenicity always route to SCCS/CIR/FDA/NMPA, not just efficacy literature
- **No evidence = say so** — "No direct clinical evidence" is always better than a hallucinated citation

## 📝 Example Output

### Product Analysis Mode

```markdown
## ⑬ Overall Score: 54 / 100 (🟢 High Confidence)

| Dimension | Weight | PS | EM | IM | Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Effectiveness | 35 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 1.00 | 26.8 |
| Architecture | 20 | 0.70 | 0.50 | 1.00 | 7.0 |
| Safety | 20 | 0.85 | 0.70 | 1.00 | 11.9 |
| Support System | 15 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 1.00 | 3.75 |
| Skin Adaptation | 10 | 0.70 | 0.70 | 1.00 | 4.9 |

## ⑭ Conclusion

**Strengths**: Well-recognized active (Niacinamide 10%) with strong clinical evidence.
**Limitations**: Simple architecture; no antioxidant support system.
**Recommendation**: Recommended for normal to oily skin seeking hyperpigmentation reduction.
```

### Citation Mode

```markdown
━━━ ① Summary / Core Answer ━━━
This product is likely suitable for oily acne-prone skin as a maintenance serum.
Primary active is azelaic acid with niacinamide as support. Low irritation risk
but not a "strong" acne treatment — better for PIH management.

━━━ ③ Evidence-Supported Claims ━━━
- Azelaic acid has clear evidence for mild-to-moderate acne and post-inflammatory
  hyperpigmentation, serving as a long-term management active [C1][C2]
- Niacinamide is an adjunct for sebum regulation and inflammation reduction —
  not a standalone "strong" acne treatment [C3]

━━━ ④ Inference & Uncertainty ━━━
- Actual azelaic acid concentration unknown from ingredient list alone
- Whether this product is "suitable for you" is formulation inference,
  not product-level clinical validation

━━━ ⑤ References / Sources ━━━
[C1] Azelaic acid in acne/PIH review (2023, review)
Source: PubMed  |  Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/xxxxxxxx/

1. **New category**: Define First Principle → Weight Profile → Domain Rules → Anti-Hallucination Rules
2. **New ingredient**: Follow M21 schema (Name / Alias / Category / Ontology / Mechanism / Evidence / Risk / Concentration / Skin Compatibility)
3. **New interaction**: Pair + Type + Mechanism + Evidence Level + IM value
